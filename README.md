# ComparisonTool
I used this comparison tool to compare a CSV and an excel file, as part of Data Quality/Data Integrity Check when we were migrating data from Athena to Redshift.
What I normally do is to run similar queries in Athena and Redshift, download their outputs, and run this comparison tool.

The GUI is still a WIP,  so if you wanna use this you may run the sh instead :)
